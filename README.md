# MuLife-F.I.Laboratory
Repository about the measurement of the muon's mean life I made with my lab team in university of Pisa for the Fundamental Interaction Laboratory course. 
The experiment is structered as following: 
1) We first constructed efficency curve for every PMT we used to see where efficency was maximum and set HV.
